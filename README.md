Magic Carpet Battle Arena
-------------------------
An Irrlicht-based game where two players ride magic carpets and fight against each other in a small arena.



Running the game:
- On 64-bit Linux, execute ./bin/Debug/MagicCarpet
- On 32-bit Linux, re-compilation is required (see Compiling)

Controls:
Up - Accelerate
Down - Decelerate
Left - Turn left
Right - Turn right
A - Punch left
D - Punch right
C - Switch camera
E - Switch environment

Please note:
- There is no collision detection or scoring for now.
- The AI player executes a simple behaviour by always steering towards the black X marking.



Compiling:
- MagicCarpet.cbp can be opened and compiled with Code::Blocks (http://www.codeblocks.org)
- The project expects the Irrlicht SDK to be extracted in a directory named "irrlicht" in the same directory as the project root.
- Alternatively, path names can be updated in the Project Build Options.
